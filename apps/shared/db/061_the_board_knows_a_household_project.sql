-- 061 - the board can tell a household project from a job.
--
-- Shahar (2026-09-11), on the Professionals board for 55 Walnut: "the
-- insurance below is a task associated with me as contractor, but not as a
-- project related. show only tasks that are project related." Insurance,
-- Mortgage, Property taxes, Internet & TV, Landscaping are the standing
-- projects a home opens for its owner (blueprint_home_projects, help topic
-- projects) - the homeowner's business, not the site's. They carry
-- projects.home_blueprint_code; a build or a booked job does not.
-- portal_my_work now says so ('household'), and the Professionals app
-- leaves them and their tasks off the board. Nothing else changes.
